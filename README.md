AUTOMATED VEHICLE NUMBER PLATE DETECTION & RECOGNITION :

 In this project, a Digital Image Processing-based prototype is de
 veloped. Actions such as Image Acquisition, enhancement that is pre
 processing, Segmentation of the license plate and then application of
 OCR(Optical Character Recognition) is applied to store the number on
 text form. The plate number is displayed as text on the terminal using
 the principle of OCR with help of Tesser act engine. It is seen that the
 security forces and authorities face problems whenever security forces
 chase a vehicle or they canâ€™t catch a vehicle which broke traffic rules.
 Authorities find it very hectic on a busy day to log the vehicle numbers
 manually in a parking lot. So, in order to make the entire process au
 tonomous, we can install this system so as to automatically detect the
 vehicle which breaks the traffic rules, take a picture of it and store the
 numberin the database so as to fine the respective owner afterwards. The
 system can be used in parking so as to take the picture of the vehicle and
 log the vehicle number in the database (or the cloud, if connected to the
 internet). This technology reduces the unnecessary hectic manual work
 if connected to the internet).
 This technology reduces the unnecessary hectic manual work number
 of any vehicle once obtained as text, can be displayed, saved in the
 database or can be searched through the entire database for the details.
 This project is so versatile that it can be used as an entire application
 once converted to a software or can be used as a part of any big project.
